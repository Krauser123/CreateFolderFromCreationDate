# CreateFolderFromCreationDate

Start as a quickly afternoon project. A friend of mine have thousands of photos mixed in severals HDD. He want order it, but he can't order by created date because a lot of files have wrong properties, others don't have metadata, same file appears in several folders , etc.

This app generates a folder by year, getting the minimum date searching between the properties and metadata of each file, then move matching files to a folder.
 
 Perhaps in the future more functionalities can be added.
