# CreateFolderFromCreationDate

It started as a quick project for an afternoon. A friend of mine have thousands of photos mixed in severals HDD. He want order it by created date, but he can't because a lot of files have wrong properties, others don't have metadata, same file appears in several folders , etc.

This app generates one folder per year, getting the lowest date by searching through the properties and metadata of each file, then moving the matching files into a folder.

Perhaps in the future more functionalities can be added.
