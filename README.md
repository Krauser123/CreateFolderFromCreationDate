# CreateFolderFromCreationDate

It started as a quick project for an afternoon. A friend of mine has thousands of photos mixed in several HDDs. He wants to order it by created date, but he can't because a lot of files have wrong properties, others don't have metadata, the same file appears in multiple folders, etc.

This app generates one folder per year, getting the lowest date by searching through the properties and metadata of each file, then moving the matching files into a folder.

Perhaps in the future, more functionalities can be added.
