# CreateFolderFromCreationDate

A very quickly afternoon project. My friend have thousands of photos mixed in severals HDD. He want order it but he can order by created date because some files have wrong properties and right metadata, others don't have metadata, etc...

 This app generates a folder by year, searching the minimun date that appears in file properties and metadatas. After, the app move these files to the right folder.
 
 Perhaps in the future more functionalities can be added.
